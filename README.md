- find solution for how to handle library changes while re-syncing
- make marketplace ready/ suitable
- add image to playlist
- add description to playlist
- clean up code
- debug
- custom compare instead of isrc (compare using title, artists and duration)
- add blacklist for songs
- add blacklist and whitelist for playlists (very unlikely)
